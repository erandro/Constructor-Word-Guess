# Constructor-Word-Guess

### Overview
a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.

### How does it work?
It's a basic hangman game where you need to guess a word - or in this case a movie. The app will give the user a Classic movie title to guess and the user will input a letter that might be in the movie title. While the user can see how many letters and words do the movie has, each guess will reveal a letter in the title or will be "wrong" (the user can be wrong only 9 times).
If the user guessed the title (or fail to do so after 9 wrong guesses) a new title will be shown up.

### Why does it useful?

This is a great example of using node.js to make a game.
This app showcase the usage of "color" and "inquirer" npm's, constructors and exports between files.
